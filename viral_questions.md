# Intro:

Joy: Hello everyone. This is Joydeep

Sherin: This is Sherin

Joy: and today we have here Viral. Welcome to the show Viral.

Viral: thankyou for calling me.

Sherin: Viral is a co-founder of many companies like [Julia Computing, Inc.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/julia-computing?trk=ppro_cprof) he is the cocreator of Circuitscape and JuliaLang which you know is a high performance functional programming language for datascience and machine learning. These dys Viral is mostly involved in the development of the Julia language and we were lucky to get some of his busy time. 

1. So tell me about yourself. Somethings about your journey till now.

2. So you are going to speak at the functional conference bangalore. How did u get associated with it

3. What were the main motivations behind the creation of the Julia language?

Here I would like to add the cofounders of the Julia language:  Julia Computing cofounders Keno Fischer, Viral Shah, Stefan Karpinski, Alan Edelman, and Jeff Bezanson

4. Why functional?

5. What were your main challenges while creating the language?

6. What are the best ways to learn the language from a beginner perspective?

7. So for development you are using git and github? If a person wants to contribute to the development of the julia language how should he start?

8. Julia is open source So how is the open source thing working out for you?

9. Talk about adoption at web companies and growth in the Julia community in general.

10. What is Julia's approach, or the most common approach taken in Julia code, to concurrency? Do you approach it like JavaScript, emitting and handling events in a single-threaded loop and avoiding synchronous IO operations, or like Erlang/Elixir, where you spin up dozens or hundreds or thousands of runtime-not-OS processes and send messages between them?

11. On a spectrum from Python to C, where does Julia tend to fall performance-wise? I understand this isn't really a question with a simple concrete answer, especially since lazy evaluation can complicate things. But should I be thinking of it as in the arena of Python/Ruby, in the arena of Java/C#, or in the arena of C/C++?

12. Am I correct in thinking that Julia compiles to native code on a targeted platform, bundling its runtime with it -- so that I could produce, say, Windows executables that anyone can run, without having a Julia interpreter VM/installed? The way Go does it, basically? I've been reading about this but I'm still not quite sure.

13. How are tests written for Julia

14. What is your vision with the language? Where do you want to see it 5/10/20 years from now?

15. If any one wants to reach you how would they do that?

16. So we are almost at the end of the podcast. Do you want to add something which we might not have covered?
